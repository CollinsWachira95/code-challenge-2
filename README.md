Shopping List - A Simple Interactive Web App

This is a basic interactive shopping list application created using HTML, CSS (for styling), and JavaScript.

Features:

Add items to the shopping list.
Mark items as purchased (visually indicated with line-through text).
Clear all items from the list.
How to Run:

Save the HTML file (e.g., index.html) and the JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) in the same directory.
Open the HTML file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox).
How to Use:

Adding Items:
Type the name of an item in the input field at the top.
Click the "Add" button.
The item will be added to your shopping list.
Marking Purchased Items:
Click the "Mark Purchased" button.
All items in the list will be marked as purchased with a line-through effect.
Clearing the List:
Click the "Clear List" button.
All items will be removed from the shopping list.
Future Enhancements (Optional):

Allow editing existing list items (clicking an item opens an edit dialog).
Implement persistence using Local Storage to save the list even after the page reloads.
Learning Outcomes:


Working with HTML elements to create a user interface.
Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) based on user interactions.
Understanding the concept of event listeners and how they are used to create interactive web applications.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to create your own customized shopping list experience!
